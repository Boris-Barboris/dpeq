# DPEQ - native PSQL extended protocol implementation for D programming language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Boris-Barboris/dpeq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Boris-Barboris/dpeq)

**dpeq** is a low-level library that implements a subset of the client side of 
PostgreSQL simple and extended query (EQ) protocols. EQ is a stateful message-based binary 
protocol working on top of TCP\IP or Unix-domain sockets. **dpeq** defines classes
to hold the required state and utility functions, that send and receive protocol
messages in sensible manner.

**dpeq** is aimed on library developers that write database middleware for
Postgres.

Here is a list of good links to get yourself familiar with EQ protocol, wich may
help you to understand the nature of the messages being passed:
